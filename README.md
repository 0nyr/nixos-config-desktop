# NixOS desktop config

This is my configuration for personal NixOS desktop configuration.

This configuration expects that dotfiles are setup for user `onyr`. See [my dotfiles config repo](https://github.com/0nyr/dotfiles) for those dotfiles. I prefered to do so, since I want to reuse those dotfiles on other distros as well.

Flake is used to make reproducible environnement.
